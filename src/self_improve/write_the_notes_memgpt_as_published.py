"""MemGPT the way MemGPT is built: one block of free text, plus an archive it must search.

Our first MemGPT arm kept numbered notes in both tiers, which is a claim store with a size
limit rather than MemGPT. Their core memory is ONE BLOCK OF FREE TEXT, and the model edits it
by naming a piece of the text and what to put in its place; their archive holds separate
passages that are only ever reached by searching. That shape is what this module adds, and it
is the difference that made the earlier arm an imitation.

The four things their agent can actually do, and the four things here:

  core_memory_append      add a line to the end of the block
  core_memory_replace     name an exact piece of the block and what replaces it. Naming a
                          piece that is not there FAILS, as theirs does - it is a substring
                          match, not a fuzzy one, and the failure is reported to the model.
  archival_memory_insert  put a passage in the archive
  archival_memory_search  ask the archive for passages, a page at a time

Sizes are theirs: `letta/constants.py` puts the persona and human blocks at 20,000 characters
each. A write that would overflow is refused and the refusal is handed back, which is a
faithful reading of the paper's prose - the research agent could not reach an enforcement
point in the code, so that is stated as a reading rather than as a match.

Two departures that remain, both disclosed rather than fixed. Moving something from the block
to the archive is two calls for them (insert, then replace with nothing) and two here as well,
so that one is faithful. But their archive search is interactive across turns - page one, then
the model asks for page two - and a nightly write here is one call, so pages are offered by
asking for more in the same reply rather than in a later turn.
