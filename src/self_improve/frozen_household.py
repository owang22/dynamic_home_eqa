"""One frozen household: its rooms, its places, and where everything really is.

We read the frozen question banks at
/home/oliver/robot/dynamic_home_eqa_fm/results/fm_memory/banks_f1 and never
write to them. Nothing here reaches a prompt: this is the harness side of the
line, the part that knows the truth.

Vocabulary used throughout src/self_improve, deliberately plain:

  room      one of the 6 to 9 rooms of the house ("kitchen", "living")
  place     one spot inside a room where things rest ("desk_o1", "couch_l1");
            there are roughly 33 to 47 of these per household
  target    something the robot can look at: a room or a place. Which of the
            two we use is the study's sensing granularity and it is a
            parameter, never a constant.
  asked object  an object the frozen question bank actually asks about. There
            are only 4 to 7 of these per household, far fewer than the
            household's 70-odd objects.
  settled period   days 0-13, the ordinary fortnight
  disrupted period days 14-23, one resident off sick
  back-to-normal period days 24-31

# re-learn +13.5, break again -8.9), and 5 of 10 households show the full
# four-phase shape.
#
# A correction to the record, because it was repeated several times: "illness_v1
# failed seven ways" was true of an EARLIER build and is NOT true of the directory
# now at results/self_improve/runs/illness_v1/. It must not be described as the
# failed scenario anywhere.

# loses only 1.6 points on the first two days back to normal against a 5-point bar,
# with a household-clustered error of 4.2 - so its return is not a change and no arm
# can be measured on it.
