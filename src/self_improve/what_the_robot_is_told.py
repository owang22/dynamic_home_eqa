"""The words the robot is given: the home, the job, its three tools, and why notes help.

Every prompt in the arm that reads its own record is built from the blocks here, so the
whole of what the model is told sits in one place a person can read straight through.

Five rules for anything added here, all of them from things that went wrong:

  - short sentences and ordinary words. No invented phrases. If a sentence needs three
    commas, it needs to be two sentences.
  - FEW EXAMPLES, AND SAY THEY ARE EXAMPLES. This model takes an example as an
    instruction: given a list of the kinds of thing to notice, it wrote the things on the
    list. Each example we give is a hypothesis we have put in its head instead of letting
    it find one, so the list is short and it is told plainly that the real range is wider.
  - NOTHING THAT DESCRIBES THIS STUDY'S DISRUPTION. An earlier draft offered "they have
    been at home all week when they are normally out" as an example of something worth
    noticing. That is the thing we are testing whether it can notice. It is cut.
  - nothing the robot could not have seen for itself. The people's names are the one thing
    that looks like an exception and is not: the objects are named after their owners, so
    "mug_yuki" is in every prompt already. Which resident is which person is NOT said,
    because the robot's own record says "resident_1" and never says more.
  - the instruction first and the reason after it. Measured: with the reason first this
    model answered a night of six fresh sightings with an empty list of edits, every time.

# EVERY WORD THAT DIFFERS BETWEEN THE FOUR WAYS OF KEEPING MEMORY IS IN THIS ONE DICT.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This exists because the two original ways of keeping memory were never given the same
# instructions, and nobody noticed until the run was half done. Seven differences, written
# up in results/self_improve/three_prompts/THE_WRITING_PROMPTS_WERE_NOT_THE_SAME.md, of
# which the worst were: the two arms were told OPPOSITE things about loss, one was told not
# to repeat itself and the other was not, and only one was asked to cite its sightings.
# Every difference we measured between the two styles was therefore confounded with a
# difference in what we told them.
#
# So the shape here is: everything shared is built by `the_nightly_prompt` below, and the
# ONLY thing a method may change is its entry in this dictionary. To add a way of keeping
# memory, add a key. If you find yourself wanting to change anything outside this dict for
# one method only, that is the confound coming back - stop and say so instead.
