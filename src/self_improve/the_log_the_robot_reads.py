"""The observation log, rendered for the model to read, instead of copied into its notes.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Counted over every claim-store run on disk on 2026-09-24: of 1,906
claims the model wrote, 91% name a place - "mug_felix is on the desk in the office" -
and six of them, 0.3%, say anything about a time, a condition or a change. 99% record
the condition they hold under as the single word "current". The memory is a table of
last-seen places.

That table already exists, for free, with dates attached and nothing garbled: it is the
robot's own observation record. Measured on the three homes where every arm has run the
same month, answering "where did I last see it" straight from that record - with no model
at all - gets the first room right for 72% of moved objects in the settled period and 70%
after the routine returns, against 44% to 52% for the arms that write notes. The notes
only draw level during the ten disrupted days.

So a memory whose content is places cannot be worth its tokens. This module gives the
model the record itself, which is strictly better than its copy of it, so that its notes
can hold the things a record cannot: when each person is where, what moves with what,
what changed and when, and where to look first.

Nothing here calls a model. It is rendering, and every line of it comes from the robot's
own looks - never from the simulator's ground truth.
