"""The ONE place the LLM prompts describe the sensing protocol.

Every LLM arm (hypothesis mixtures, treeLongLeaf, log reader, notebook
mixture and its dispatcher) tells the model how the robot observes the
home and what a look costs. Those mechanics differ by bank:

* the classic banks: a look opens ONE receptacle, costs one unit of a
  per-day look budget, and a resident can be looked at after being listed;
* the human inspector's protocol (``situation_eval`` banks, header
  ``protocol.room_level_looks``): a look is a whole ROOM, costs
  ``look_cost`` in the robot's current room and ``look_cost + travel_cost``
  anywhere else, budget resets at midnight with the robot back in its home
  base room, and pockets are never seen;
* the patrol protocol (``patrol`` banks, header ``protocol.free_look``): the
  robot patrols every room every ``patrol_hours`` hours, and before answering
  a question it may look at ONE room for free. No budget, no travel, no
  carry-over between questions.

The patrol banks also carry a resident intro card per resident
(``protocol.residents``) and, in the told arm, dated resident messages
(``protocol.hint_messages``); :func:`household_notes` renders both for any
prompt.

The bank header's ``protocol`` block (carried on ``EpisodeContext.protocol``)
selects the wording. With no block, every function below returns exactly
the sentences the prompts used before this module existed, so old banks
produce byte-identical prompts.

Edit the ROOM-LOOK wording here; nothing else in the prompt files states
costs or budgets.
