"""Build a patrol bank from a situation_sim run.

    python3 -m baselines.patrol.bank --run ../data/situation_sim/week8/hh_s0 \
        --patrol-hours 4 --out ../results/overnight/banks/hh_s0_p4.jsonl

What goes into the bank (all rows the loader in baselines.bank understands):

* the sim's header, plus a ``protocol`` block every agent may read (the
  resident intro cards, patrol density, walkthrough time, day 0's weekday)
  and harness-only fields (``day_causes``, ``shift_days``,
  ``hint_messages``) that never reach an agent's context;
* the sim's truth and resident rows (ground truth, harness-only);
* the walkthrough: one ``initial_tour`` observation per object found in
  the home on Tuesday at 18:00, plus one ``room_visit`` per room listing
  the EMPTY spots (so the walkthrough's exclusions reach the beliefs);
* the patrol: every ``patrol_hours`` hours after the walkthrough, one
  ``room_visit`` per room with the full contents of every spot in it
  (residents present are stamped on by the loader from the resident rows);
* 32 questions per scored day (Wednesday .. next Tuesday), uniform over
  movable objects, at times uniform over 07:00-23:00.

Same seed and patrol density -> byte-identical file.
