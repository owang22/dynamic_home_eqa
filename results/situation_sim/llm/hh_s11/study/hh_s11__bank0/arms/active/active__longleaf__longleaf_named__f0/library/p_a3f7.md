# p_a3f7 — Dog home all day; midday feeding; both 9-to-5 (fork of p_7c29)

The parent (p_7c29) assumed the dog is at a daycare facility Monday through Friday, so the food bag stays sealed in the pantry and the toy is stowed on the storage shelf during work hours. The claim tally for the food bag has now turned against the parent twice: on two weekday-midday looks the bag was NOT in the pantry, which is hard to explain if the dog is away and nobody is opening the bag. This fork removes the daycare entirely. The dog is home all day and gets a midday meal around 11:00–12:00, which pulls the food bag to the kitchen floor. The toy stays on the living-room floor because the dog is here to play with it, and the bowl sits at the kitchen floor around the clock. Both residents still hold 9:00–17:00 office jobs, so their keys, phones, tablets, and jackets are out of the house during that window. What sets this apart from the parent: the dog food bag is at floor_k_k1 during weekday midday (not pantry), and the dog toy is on the living-room floor (not storage_shelf_s1). What would refute it: finding the food bag in the pantry AND the toy in storage simultaneously on a weekday at 12:00, or finding the dog leash at the entry hook on a weekday at 12:00 (no walk needed if the dog is already home and the resident is at work).
