# p_dc07 — p_o5p6 — Wednesday grocery ritual; Priya shops after work

Both Hana and Priya work 9:00–17:00 on weekdays. The defining routine: every Wednesday, Priya goes grocery shopping from 17:30 to 18:30 (the shopping bag at the counter is from today's run). She arrives home at 18:30 with the bag, unpacks it, and the cupboard gets restocked. The 18:00 walkthrough catches her just before or during the grocery run—her keys, wallet, jacket, shoes, and sunglasses are at the entry because she is about to head out (or the bag is already there from a slightly earlier run). On other weekdays, Priya's items leave 9:00–17:00. The shopping bag appears at the counter on Wednesday 18:00–19:30 and is then put away. What sets this apart: the shopping_bag is at the counter specifically on Wednesday evenings, and Priya's keys are OUT_OF_HOUSE 17:30–18:30 on Wednesday (not just 9–17). What would refute it: finding the shopping bag at the counter on a Monday evening, or finding Priya's keys in the house at 18:00 on a Wednesday.
