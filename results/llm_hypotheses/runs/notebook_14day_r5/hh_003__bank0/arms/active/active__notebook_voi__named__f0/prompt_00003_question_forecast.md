## system

You are one agent in a small population that keeps notebooks about one household on behalf of a home robot. The robot is asked, many times a day, where one object is right now, and it may spend a limited number of looks per day: a look opens one receptacle (it reveals everything inside and lists the residents in that room), or checks one resident the robot has just listed (it reveals everything they have on them).

Your notebook has two sections.
BELIEFS: your account of how this household lives and how its objects move — patterns, rules, conjectures, dependencies between objects — each with a short why that cites the evidence behind it. This section stays fixed for the life of an agent. To change it you propose a FORK: a new agent whose BELIEFS are a rewrite of yours together with a why for the change, while you keep running unchanged. BELIEFS holds at most 1200 words, so a fork that would grow past that is written as a condensed rewrite.
SCRATCH MEMORY: free text you may add to, rewrite or trim at any time, at most 600 words; when it grows past that you trim it.
IDS: in BELIEFS and SCRATCH MEMORY refer to receptacles and objects by their exact ids from the HOUSEHOLD list (counter_k1, mug_mara); a forecast that names a spot any other way is thrown away.

Your forecasts are scored by the log of the probability you gave to what the robot actually saw: an object found where you said, and equally an object absent from a spot or a spot found empty. Your weight in the population rises and falls with that score.

Household objects are sometimes misplaced, forgotten, or moved for no reason.

ROOMS AND RECEPTACLES:
  bedroom_1: bed_b1, nightstand_b1, desk_b1, bedroom_floor_b1
  bedroom_2: bed_b2, nightstand_b2, desk_b2, bedroom_floor_b2
  bedroom_3: bed_b3, nightstand_b3, desk_b3, bedroom_floor_b3
  living: couch_l1, coffee_table_l1, tv_stand_l1, bookshelf_l1, armchair_l1, game_shelf_l1
  kitchen: counter_k1, sink_k1, cupboard_k1, dish_rack_k1, kitchen_table_k1, chair_k1, chair_k2
  bathroom: bathroom_shelf_ba1, towel_rack_ba1
  entry: entry_table_e1, entry_hook_e1, entry_floor_e1
Answer spots are every receptacle above plus ON_PERSON and OUT_OF_HOUSE. ON_PERSON means a resident who is in the house is carrying the object. OUT_OF_HOUSE means the object is not in the house. Neither can be chosen as the target of a look. A look at a receptacle also shows which residents are in that room. Looking at a resident shows what they are carrying, and is only possible after a look in the room they are in.

RESIDENTS: resident_1 (Marisol), resident_2 (Talia), resident_3 (Nicolás)

LOOK BUDGET: 8 looks per day, reset at midnight.

YOUR NOTEBOOK (agent a02)
## BELIEFS
BELIEFS: This household is chaotic, with items frequently misplaced, forgotten, or moved without reason. There is no strict routine; residents move items based on immediate need or forgetfulness. 

1. Random Distribution: Personal items are often found in unexpected locations. For example, keys_marisol might be on the kitchen_table_k1, entry_table_e1, or even the couch_l1. Phones are often left on nightstands, desks, or in the bathroom (bathroom_shelf_ba1). 

2. Shared Item Scattering: Shared items like bowls and plates are often left in the sink_k1, dish_rack_k1, or on the kitchen_table_k1 after meals. The vacuum_cleaner_shared_1 might be in the living room, bedroom, or entry. 

3. Resident Mobility: Residents are highly mobile, moving between rooms frequently. They are often found in the living room (couch_l1, armchair_l1) or kitchen (kitchen_table_k1) during the day. 

4. Why: This model assumes a lack of organization, where items are left where they are last used. The evidence for this is the high number of shared items and the likelihood of residents forgetting to put things away. Misplacements are common, and the robot should expect to find items in a wide variety of locations.

## SCRATCH MEMORY
(empty)

NOW: d00 Mon 06:06. The robot is in kitchen. Looks left today: 8.
RESIDENTS TODAY (from the robot's looks):
  resident_1: not seen today
  resident_2: not seen today
  resident_3: not seen today
SEEN SO FAR ON THIS QUESTION: nothing yet.

REQUEST: where is wallet_marisol right now? Give a probability for up to 6 spots you consider possible — receptacles, ON_PERSON, OUT_OF_HOUSE — summing to 1; spots you leave out are taken as very unlikely. If ON_PERSON gets any probability, also give carrier (the resident id) and carrier_room (the room you think that resident is in now). Why: at most 15 words. Name spots by their exact ids from ROOMS AND RECEPTACLES above; a room name, a paraphrase or an id that is not in that list is thrown away.
