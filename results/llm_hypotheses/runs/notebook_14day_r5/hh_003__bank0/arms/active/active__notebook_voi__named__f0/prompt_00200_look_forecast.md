## system

You are one agent in a small population that keeps notebooks about one household on behalf of a home robot. The robot is asked, many times a day, where one object is right now, and it may spend a limited number of looks per day: a look opens one receptacle (it reveals everything inside and lists the residents in that room), or checks one resident the robot has just listed (it reveals everything they have on them).

Your notebook has two sections.
BELIEFS: your account of how this household lives and how its objects move — patterns, rules, conjectures, dependencies between objects — each with a short why that cites the evidence behind it. This section stays fixed for the life of an agent. To change it you propose a FORK: a new agent whose BELIEFS are a rewrite of yours together with a why for the change, while you keep running unchanged. BELIEFS holds at most 1200 words, so a fork that would grow past that is written as a condensed rewrite.
SCRATCH MEMORY: free text you may add to, rewrite or trim at any time, at most 600 words; when it grows past that you trim it.
IDS: in BELIEFS and SCRATCH MEMORY refer to receptacles and objects by their exact ids from the HOUSEHOLD list (counter_k1, mug_mara); a forecast that names a spot any other way is thrown away.

Your forecasts are scored by the log of the probability you gave to what the robot actually saw: an object found where you said, and equally an object absent from a spot or a spot found empty. Your weight in the population rises and falls with that score.

Household objects are sometimes misplaced, forgotten, or moved for no reason.

  bathroom: bathroom_shelf_ba1, towel_rack_ba1
  entry: entry_table_e1, entry_hook_e1, entry_floor_e1
Answer spots are every receptacle above plus ON_PERSON and OUT_OF_HOUSE. ON_PERSON means a resident who is in the house is carrying the object. OUT_OF_HOUSE means the object is not in the house. Neither can be chosen as the target of a look. A look at a receptacle also shows which residents are in that room. Looking at a resident shows what they are carrying, and is only possible after a look in the room they are in.

RESIDENTS: resident_1 (Marisol), resident_2 (Talia), resident_3 (Nicolás)

LOOK BUDGET: 8 looks per day, reset at midnight.

YOUR NOTEBOOK (agent a01)
## BELIEFS
BELIEFS: This household operates on a rigid, predictable schedule with strict personal boundaries. Each resident has a designated bedroom (bedroom_1: Marisol, bedroom_2: Talia, bedroom_3: Nicolás) and a designated desk (desk_b1, desk_b2, desk_b3) where their personal items reside during the day. 

1. Personal Item Localization: Personal objects (e.g., keys_marisol, phone_marisol, wallet_marisol) are almost always found in the owner's bedroom or on their person. Specifically, keys and wallets are kept in the bedroom nightstand (nightstand_b1, nightstand_b2, nightstand_b3) when not in use. Phones are on the desk or in the bedroom. 

2. Shared Item Centralization: Shared items (bowl_shared_1, plate_shared_1, pan_shared_1, pot_shared_1) are located in the kitchen (counter_k1, cupboard_k1, sink_k1). The vacuum_cleaner_shared_1 is stored in the entry (entry_floor_e1) or living room (armchair_l1). The dog_leash_shared_1 is on the entry_hook_e1. 

3. Movement Patterns: Objects do not move between rooms unless a resident is actively using them. For example, a laptop_talia stays on desk_b2 or bed_b2. A gaming_controller_shared_1 stays on game_shelf_l1 or couch_l1. 

4. Resident Presence: Residents are in their bedrooms during early morning (00:00-07:00) and late night (22:00-00:00). During the day, they rotate between their bedroom, the kitchen, and the living room. 

5. Why: This model assumes a disciplined household where items are returned to their 'home' spots after use. The evidence for this is the clear separation of personal vs. shared items in the object list. Misplacements are rare and usually result from a resident being interrupted, leaving an item on a surface (e.g., coffee_table_l1) rather than in a different room.

## SCRATCH MEMORY
d01 Tue 06:20-06:26: counter_k1 is the central morning staging area for daily-carry items (backpacks, mugs, bottles, phones, chargers, lunchboxes). Marisol’s items (mug_marisol, water_bottle_marisol, notebook_marisol, pen_marisol, charger_marisol) consistently appear here. High-value items (keys, wallet, glasses, meds, jacket) remain absent from the counter and kitchen, confirming they are stored in the bedroom or carried on person, not staged in the kitchen. sink_k1 is a transient spot for single dishes (plate_shared_1), not storage. resident_1 (Marisol) was present in the kitchen holding only phone_marisol; absence of keys/wallet/glasses/meds/jacket on person confirms they are not carried to the kitchen staging area. Forecast adjustment: lower probability for keys/wallet/glasses/meds/jacket in kitchen/counter checks (previous overestimation of 0.45/0.35 caused score drops). Focus high probability on daily-carry items (mugs, bottles, phones, chargers, backpacks) for counter_k1.
d01 Tue 06:26: d01 Tue 06:26: nightstand_b2 held only headphones_talia; resident_2 present. Keys/wallet/phone absent, contradicting 'nightstand storage' belief. Talia likely carries keys/wallet/phone on person or in backpack during morning staging. Lower P for these in nightstand_b2; raise P for ON_PERSON or backpack_talia.

NOW: d01 Tue 06:33. The robot is in bedroom_2. Looks left today: 0.
RESIDENTS TODAY (from the robot's looks):
  resident_1: kitchen 06:20, kitchen 06:21, kitchen 06:24, kitchen 06:26, kitchen 06:26 · last seen 06:26 in kitchen
  resident_2: bedroom_2 06:26 · last seen 06:26 in bedroom_2
  resident_3: not seen today
SEEN SO FAR ON THIS QUESTION: nothing yet.

REQUEST: the robot is about to look at receptacle bathroom_shelf_ba1 (in bathroom). For up to 8 objects you think may be there right now, give the probability that it is there — each object is its own yes/no probability. Objects you leave out are taken as very unlikely to be there. Name objects by their exact ids from OBJECTS; a class name or a paraphrase is thrown away.
