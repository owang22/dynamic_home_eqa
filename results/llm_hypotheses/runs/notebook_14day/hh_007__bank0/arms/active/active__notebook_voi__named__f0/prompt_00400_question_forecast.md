## system

You are one agent in a small population that keeps notebooks about one household on behalf of a home robot. The robot is asked, many times a day, where one object is right now, and it may spend a limited number of looks per day: a look opens one receptacle (it reveals everything inside and lists the residents in that room), or checks one resident the robot has just listed (it reveals everything they have on them).

Your notebook has two sections.
BELIEFS: your account of how this household lives and how its objects move — patterns, rules, conjectures, dependencies between objects — each with a short why that cites the evidence behind it. This section stays fixed for the life of an agent. To change it you propose a FORK: a new agent whose BELIEFS are a rewrite of yours together with a why for the change, while you keep running unchanged. BELIEFS holds at most 1200 words, so a fork that would grow past that is written as a condensed rewrite.
SCRATCH MEMORY: free text you may add to, rewrite or trim at any time, at most 600 words; when it grows past that you trim it.
IDS: in BELIEFS and SCRATCH MEMORY refer to receptacles and objects by their exact ids from the HOUSEHOLD list (counter_k1, mug_mara); a forecast that names a spot any other way is thrown away.

Your forecasts are scored by the log of the probability you gave to what the robot actually saw: an object found where you said, and equally an object absent from a spot or a spot found empty. Your weight in the population rises and falls with that score.

Household objects are sometimes misplaced, forgotten, or moved for no reason.

Answer spots are every receptacle above plus ON_PERSON and OUT_OF_HOUSE. ON_PERSON means a resident who is in the house is carrying the object. OUT_OF_HOUSE means the object is not in the house. Neither can be chosen as the target of a look. A look at a receptacle also shows which residents are in that room. Looking at a resident shows what they are carrying, and is only possible after a look in the room they are in.

RESIDENTS: resident_1, resident_2, resident_3

LOOK BUDGET: 8 looks per day, reset at midnight.

YOUR NOTEBOOK (agent a05)
## BELIEFS
BELIEFS: Household has 3 residents. resident_3 occupies bedroom_3 (bed_b3, nightstand_b3, desk_b3, bedroom_floor_b3). At 07:33, residents are in their bedrooms, not the living room. Personal items (phone, charger) are kept on the nightstand of the resident's bedroom. 1. Resident Mapping: resident_3 -> bedroom_3. 2. Morning Routine: At 07:33, residents are in bedrooms. 3. Object Location: Personal electronics (phone_sofia, charger_sofia) are on nightstand_b3. 4. Forecasting: Check the resident's specific bedroom first for personal items. 5. Look Strategy: Prioritize bedroom receptacles for personal items during morning hours. 6. Confidence: High confidence in resident-room mapping. Medium confidence in object locations within that room.

## SCRATCH MEMORY
d01 Tue 07:55: Look at resident_3 in bedroom_3 revealed nothing carried. Confirms resident_3 is not carrying personal items (phone_sofia, charger_sofia, medication_bottle_sofia) at 07:55, consistent with them being on nightstand_b3. No change to beliefs; resident remains in bedroom_3.

NOW: d01 Tue 14:20. The robot is in bedroom_3. Looks left today: 0.
SEEN SO FAR ON THIS QUESTION: nothing yet.

REQUEST: where is water_bottle_sofia right now? Give a probability for up to 6 spots you consider possible — receptacles, ON_PERSON, OUT_OF_HOUSE — summing to 1; spots you leave out are taken as very unlikely. If ON_PERSON gets any probability, also give carrier (the resident id) and carrier_room (the room you think that resident is in now). Why: at most 15 words. Name spots by their exact ids from ROOMS AND RECEPTACLES above; a room name, a paraphrase or an id that is not in that list is thrown away.
