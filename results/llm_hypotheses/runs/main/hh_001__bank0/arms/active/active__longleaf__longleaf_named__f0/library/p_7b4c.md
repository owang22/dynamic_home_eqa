# p_7b4c — Mara works from a co-working space; water bottle stays home some days; pan at kitchen table (fork of p_9e2b)

This fork of p_9e2b makes two corrections driven by the latest claim failures. First, the water bottle's OUT_OF_HOUSE block (weekday 9–14, "usually") has gone against 2 times — the bottle was found in the house during weekday work hours. Combined with the 5-receptacle scatter (22 sightings across counter, kitchen table, bathroom shelf, and two others), the water bottle is not a reliable travelling object. It goes out some days but stays home others. This fork changes the OUT_OF_HOUSE chance from "usually" to "sometimes" and adds a kitchen_table_k1 block for weekday 9–14 (where it sits when it stays home, near the laptop's usual spot).

Second, the pan's 7–9 counter block (11 against) is replaced with a kitchen_table_k1 default, matching the per-object "mostly kitchen_table_k1" data. The 17–19 counter block is also removed.

What changed from p_9e2b: (1) water_bottle_mara OUT_OF_HOUSE weekday 8.5–14.5 changed from "usually" to "sometimes." (2) Added water_bottle_mara at kitchen_table_k1 weekday 9–14 "sometimes" (stays-home location). (3) class:pan default changed from sink_k1 to kitchen_table_k1. (4) Removed class:pan 7–9 and 17–19 counter_k1 blocks. (5) Updated the water bottle claim and the pan claim.

What sets this apart from p_9e2b: at 11:00 on a weekday, the water bottle may be at the kitchen table (not out of the house); the pan is at the kitchen table (not the counter) at 08:00. What would refute it: the water bottle found at the counter during weekday 9–14 (meaning it is at the counter, not the table or out), or the pan found at the counter during 7–9.
