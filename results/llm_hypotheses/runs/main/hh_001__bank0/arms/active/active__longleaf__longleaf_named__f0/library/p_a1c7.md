# p_a1c7 — Mara works from a co-working space (9:00–14:00); water bottle at couch; evening medication at counter (fork of p_e7a3)

Mara lives alone and works from a co-working space or library from 9:00 to 14:00 on weekdays, taking her laptop, charger, and lunchbox with her. The tablet stays home at the coffee table. The kitchen table is the evening and weekend workspace for the laptop. The medication bottle lives at the bathroom shelf for the 8:00 morning dose, but Mara moves it to the kitchen counter for the 18:00 evening dose as part of her dinner preparation. The water bottle is her couch companion — it sits at the coffee table or couch during leisure time, goes to the kitchen counter in the morning (6:00–9:00) while she makes coffee, and travels with her to the co-working space on weekday mornings. The pan is at the sink when not in use but moves to the counter during morning cooking (7:00–9:00). The suitcase stays on the bedroom floor and does not leave the house on a regular schedule.

What changed from p_e7a3 and why: (1) water_bottle_mara default changed from kitchen_table_k1 to couch_l1 — the per-object data shows "mostly couch_l1 (4/7 sighted days)" and the mixture's worst-objects list flagged "predicted couch_l1, actually counter_k1 3x at 07:00," confirming the couch is the resting place and the counter is the morning staging spot. (2) Added medication_bottle_mara at counter_k1 17–19 "sometimes" — the mixture flagged "predicted bathroom_shelf_ba1, actually counter_k1 2x, e.g. day 3 18:00," indicating an evening-dose routine at the counter. (3) Added laptop_mara at bookshelf_l1 0–24 "rarely" — the mixture flagged "predicted kitchen_table_k1, actually bookshelf_l1 2x, e.g. day 5 11:00," suggesting the laptop is occasionally stored or used at the bookshelf. (4) Added class:pan at counter_k1 7–9 "sometimes" — the mixture flagged "predicted kitchen_table_k1, actually counter_k1 4x, e.g. day 5 08:00," showing morning cooking at the counter. (5) Removed suitcase_mara OUT_OF_HOUSE block — it failed (0.02 on 8 sightings); the suitcase never leaves on a regular schedule. (6) Removed class:mug kitchen_table_k1 7–8.5h block — it failed (0.17 on 5 sightings); mugs stay in the cupboard in the morning. (7) Split class:plate into individual plate targets matching per-object data (plate_shared_1 at kitchen_table, plate_shared_2 at counter).

What sets this apart from p_e7a3: the water bottle is at couch_l1 (not kitchen_table_k1) as its default; the medication bottle is at counter_k1 during 17–19; the pan is at counter_k1 during 7–9; the suitcase has no OUT_OF_HOUSE block; mugs do not go to the kitchen table at 7–8.5. What would refute it: the water bottle found at kitchen_table_k1 on a weekend afternoon, the medication bottle found at the bathroom shelf at 18:00, or the laptop found at the kitchen table during weekday 9–14.

_(targets the fork left unstated are inherited from p_e7a3)_
