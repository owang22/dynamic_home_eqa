# p_4b1d — The kitchen table is the single drop-zone; the bedroom desk is never used

This is a spatial-organization hypothesis rather than a schedule hypothesis. Mara's home has one active surface: the kitchen table. Every loose object — laptop, charger, headphones, water bottle, notebook, pen, tablet (when not on the coffee table) — gets set down at the kitchen table. The bedroom desk_b1 is essentially a closet or a dead surface; no object is ever seen there. The counter_k1 is a secondary surface for the notebook, lunchbox, and plates during meal prep.

This document makes no claim about whether Mara works from home, commutes, or is a student. It only asserts where objects rest when they are not in active use. The kitchen table is the "home base" for tech and work items; the coffee table is the "home base" for leisure items (tablet in the evening, remote, blanket, book); the bathroom shelf holds toiletries and medication; the cupboard holds clean dishes and mugs when not in use.

What sets this apart: it predicts the laptop, charger, headphones, and water bottle at kitchen_table_k1 at ALL times (not just 9–17), because that is where they are stored between uses. It predicts the desk_b1 is empty. It predicts the notebook at counter_k1 (not kitchen table, not cupboard). What would refute it: any of these tech objects found at desk_b1, or the notebook found at the cupboard or kitchen table as its resting place.
