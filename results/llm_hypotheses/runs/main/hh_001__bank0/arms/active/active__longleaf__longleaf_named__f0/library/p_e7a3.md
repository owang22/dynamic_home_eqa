# p_e7a3 — Mara works from a co-working space (9:00–14:00); laptop and charger travel; tablet stays at coffee table (fork of p_d9f5)

Mara lives alone. She works from a co-working space or library from 9:00 to 14:00 on weekdays, taking her laptop and charger with her. The tablet stays home at the coffee table — it is her leisure and evening-work device, not her work device. The lunchbox is packed for her work lunch and goes out with her on weekday mornings. The kitchen table is the evening and weekend workspace: the laptop returns after 14:00 and sits there for longer sessions. The medication bottle is at the bathroom shelf — she takes it there as part of her bathroom routine at 8:00 and 20:00. The bowls are at the entry table and kitchen table, not the cupboard. The yoga mat is on the couch, used on weekend mornings. The suitcase is for occasional trips and stays on the bedroom floor.

What changed from p_d9f5 and why: (1) The laptop is no longer in the bedroom during weekday 9–17. The claim "laptop at bedroom_floor_b1 weekday 9–17" went against 6 times. The per-object data shows the laptop is "mostly kitchen_table_k1" overall but is absent from the kitchen table 4 out of 5 times during weekday 9–17 — consistent with it being OUT_OF_HOUSE. (2) The charger shows the identical pattern (kitchen_table_k1 mostly, absent 4/5 during 9–17), so it travels with the laptop. (3) The lunchbox is no longer "always at the counter." The claim went against 4 times since the last call. The per-object data shows it at 3 different receptacles and only "mostly counter_k1 (1/3 sighted days)." It goes out with Mara on weekday mornings. (4) The prose now says she works from a co-working space rather than "from the living room," which is consistent with the laptop and charger leaving the house.

What sets this apart from p_d9f5: the laptop and charger are OUT_OF_HOUSE during weekday 9–14 (not in the bedroom). The lunchbox is OUT_OF_HOUSE during weekday 9–14 (not always at the counter). What sets this apart from p_a3f1: p_a3f1 does not explicitly model the laptop or charger as travelling; this document does. What would refute it: the laptop found in the house during weekday 9–14, the charger found at the kitchen table during weekday 9–14, or the tablet found OUT_OF_HOUSE on a weekday.
