# call 3: plate_shared_1 at d00 Mon 15:20

## system

You control a home robot's memory. You read its sighting log and decide, for one question at a time, whether to look inside a receptacle or to answer where an object is.

## user

A home robot patrols a home and records what it sees. You will be given its log, then one question. Decide whether to look inside one receptacle first, or to answer now.

RECEPTACLES (every place an object can be):
  bed_b1  in bedroom
  nightstand_b1  in bedroom
  desk_b1  in bedroom
  bedroom_floor_b1  in bedroom
  couch_l1  in living
  coffee_table_l1  in living
  tv_stand_l1  in living
  bookshelf_l1  in living
  armchair_l1  in living
  counter_k1  in kitchen
  sink_k1  in kitchen
  cupboard_k1  in kitchen
  dish_rack_k1  in kitchen
  kitchen_table_k1  in kitchen
  chair_k1  in kitchen
  chair_k2  in kitchen
  bathroom_shelf_ba1  in bathroom
  towel_rack_ba1  in bathroom
  entry_table_e1  in entry
  entry_hook_e1  in entry
  entry_floor_e1  in entry
  ON_PERSON
  OUT_OF_HOUSE
ON_PERSON means a resident who is in the house is carrying the object. OUT_OF_HOUSE means the object is not in the house. Neither can be chosen as the target of a look.

LOG FORMAT: one line per event, oldest first. "dNN Day HH:MM <object> at <receptacle>" is a sighting; "dNN Day HH:MM look <receptacle>: <objects>" lists everything found inside that receptacle at that moment. Lines tagged [walkthrough] are from the robot's installation tour. The log lists what the robot saw; it is the only information there is.

SENSING: one look inspects one receptacle and reports every object inside it. Each look costs from a daily budget of 24 that resets at midnight. A look answers the current question and also stays in the log for every later question, so a look can be spent on learning rather than on the question at hand. There is no penalty for spending budget beyond not having it later.

SCORING: an answer scores one point if its first ranked receptacle is where the object actually is at the question's time, and zero otherwise.

OUTPUT: one JSON object. Either {"action": "sense", "receptacle": "<receptacle id>", "why": "..."} or {"action": "answer", "ranked": ["<most likely receptacle>", "...up to 5..."], "why": "..."}. Use receptacle ids exactly as listed.

NOW: d00 Mon 15:20
BUDGET: 24 looks left today; at most 21 more looks on this question.

## reply

{"action": "answer", "ranked": ["cupboard_k1"], "why": "The only sighting of plate_shared_1 is at cupboard_k1 during the walkthrough at 15:08. No subsequent events in the log indicate it has been moved, and the current time (15:20) is only 12 minutes later, making it highly likely to remain in its last known location."}
