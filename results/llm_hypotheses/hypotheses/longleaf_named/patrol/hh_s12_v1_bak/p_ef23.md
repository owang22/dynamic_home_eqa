# p_ef23 — The office room is Elena's dedicated workspace, used every weekday

Elena works from the office room (o1) every single weekday. She does not commute to a town office; her "office" is at home. From 8:00 to 17:30 on weekdays she is at desk_o1 with her laptop, charger, pen, notebook, and water bottle. The office chair is in use. Plant_pot_3 stays on desk_o1 permanently. On weekends the office is empty. This means the office room is occupied by Elena for most of the weekday, and her "work items" are at desk_o1 (not OUT_OF_HOUSE). What sets this apart: laptop_elena is at desk_o1 (not OUT_OF_HOUSE, not coffee_table_l1) between 9:00 and 16:00 on every weekday. The entry hook still has her helmet and bike-lock (for weekend cycling) but they don't go out on weekdays. What would refute it: laptop_elena at coffee_table_l1 at 12:00 on a Wednesday, or laptop_elena OUT_OF_HOUSE on a Tuesday.
