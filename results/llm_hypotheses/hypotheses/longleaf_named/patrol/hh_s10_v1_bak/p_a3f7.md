# p_a3f7 — The entry is a drop zone; Yuki dumps, Omar scatters

At 18:00 on a Tuesday, Yuki has just walked in from her office (back at 17:30) and has heaped her backpack, keys, jacket, water bottle, sunglasses, wallet, notebook, and laptop onto the entry hook and table. Omar is at his afternoon-to-night shift (out 13:40–23:00), so his stuff is where he left it that morning: mug and bowl on the kitchen table, book and glasses on the nightstand, controller at the TV stand, tablet at the kitchen chair. The entry is not a storage area; it is a transient dump. By 08:00 the next morning, Yuki will have moved her keys, wallet, and water bottle back to the hook/table for the commute, and her laptop and notebook will be in her backpack. Omar's bike lock and helmet sit at the entry because he cycles to his shift on some days. What sets this hypothesis apart: the entry hook is bare of Yuki's personal items between 09:00 and 17:00 on weekdays (she's at work with them). What would refute it: keys_yuki or wallet_yuki sighted at entry_table_e1 or entry_hook_e1 between 09:00 and 17:00 on a weekday.
