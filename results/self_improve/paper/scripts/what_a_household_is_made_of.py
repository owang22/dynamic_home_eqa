"""The shape of a household, read from the frozen question banks the study actually ran on.

The numbers a methods section needs: residents, rooms, places, objects, the objects the questions
ask about, and how many of those change room while a resident is ill. Everything here is counted
from the bank file, never from a docstring - the loader's own docstring says "6 to 9 rooms" and
"70-odd objects" and only one of those turns out to be right for these households.
