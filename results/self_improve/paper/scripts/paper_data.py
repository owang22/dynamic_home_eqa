"""The row loaders and the object sets every figure and analysis shares.

BOTH-SPELL MOVERS. `search_driven.the_movers` fixes the mover set from the FIRST illness only
(days 14 to 23, at spot level), so on the 50-day bank it includes objects the second illness leaves
where they normally are - 8 of its 22, four of them belonging to a resident who never falls ill.
Every day-14-against-day-32 number therefore needs the objects that move in BOTH spells, which is
what `both_spell_movers` returns: recomputed from the bank rather than hard-coded, and checked
against the list in the brief.
