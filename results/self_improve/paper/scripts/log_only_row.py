"""The log-only arm beside the ten-household table: is the raw record enough on its own?

Same households, same banks, same seed, same eight questions a day as Table 1. The arm reads the
control's search-time prompt with the object's raw log in it and an empty notes block, and never
writes a note. So the difference between it and `log and notes` is exactly what the summaries add
on top of the record, and the difference between it and `last-seen` is what the model's reading of
the record adds over a rule that walks back through it.

Anything not finished is named and left out; partial households are never pooled with anything.
