# p_7f1e — The 18:00 Kitchen Shift; Priya's Weekday Dinner Prep

On weekdays Priya cooks dinner between 18:00 and 20:00 while Hana is out at work (13:40–23:00). The robot's 18:00 pass catches the cooking items in their storage positions — pan and pot in the cupboard, knife and spatula in the drawer, recipe book in the pantry, cutting board at the sink — and the 20:00 pass finds them all on the counter or at the sink, meaning the cooking happened in the gap. The cutting board ends up at the sink (washing up). At 20:00 Priya is in the dining room eating. This document isolates the 18–20 h weekday cooking window, which p_789a (midnight cook) and p_e5f6 (breakfast) do not cover. The items are in use, not at rest, during this window.

What would refute this document: a look at the cupboard at 19:00 on a weekday that still finds the pan or pot; a resident look showing Hana in the kitchen at 18:30 (she should be out at work); a look at the counter at 19:00 that finds none of the cooking items.
