# p_3e7a — No weekday cycling; both drive to work; cycling is a weekend ritual

Yuki (early fifties) and Omar (late twenties) both commute by car or transit on weekdays. Neither puts on a helmet or grabs a bike lock in the morning. Their cycling helmets hang at the entry hook and their bike locks sit on the entry table all day, visible to the robot at every patrol pass. Cycling is a weekend-morning hobby: on Saturdays (and probably Sundays) both helmets and both locks disappear from the entry for a joint ride around 10:00–13:00, then come back.

What leaves the house on weekdays is the *work bag*, not the cycling gear. Yuki takes her laptop, keys, water bottle, notebook, jacket, shoes, sunglasses, wallet, backpack, and phone out at roughly 8:00 and back at 17:30. Omar takes his keys, wallet, jacket, shoes, handbag, lunchbox, notebook, pen, and scarf out at roughly 13:30 and back at 23:00. Their helmets and locks never join that trip.

This hypothesis is refuted if the robot finds either helmet or either bike lock missing from the entry during a weekday work window, or if it finds Yuki's laptop or keys still at the entry at 10:00 on a weekday (meaning she did not take them to the office).
