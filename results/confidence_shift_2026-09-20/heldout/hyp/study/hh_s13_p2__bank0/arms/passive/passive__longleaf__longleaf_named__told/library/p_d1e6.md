# p_d1e6 — The Early Bird: up at 6:30, Hana out by 7:30, kitchen clear by 9

Everything happens an hour earlier. Both residents are up by 6:30. Breakfast is 7:00–7:30. Hana leaves for work at 7:30 (back 17:30). Priya's walk is 8:00–9:00. The kitchen is cleared and everything put back by 9:00. Priya's errands are 13:00–15:00. Guitar 18:00–19:30. TV 19:30–21:30. Bedtime 21:30.

What sets this apart: at 8:00 on a weekday, Hana's keys, jacket, and laptop are already OUT_OF_HOUSE (in the standard hypothesis they leave at 8:00, so the 8:00 patrol might still catch them at the entry). At 8:00 the kitchen table is clear of plates and mugs (breakfast already done). Priya's keys are OUT_OF_HOUSE at 8:00 (she's on her walk). What would refute it: Hana's keys at entry_table_e1 at 8:00 on a weekday, or plates on kitchen_table_k1 at 8:00.
