# p_e7b3 — Transit commuter; charger stays; Priya's glasses at nightstand (fork of p_a3f7)

Elena (early fifties) works an office job in town and commutes by transit or on foot. She is out from roughly 8:00 to 17:30 on weekdays. She does **not** cycle to work: her helmet and bike lock remain at the entry throughout the workday, and the robot has found them there on every weekday patrol. What she **does** take with her is her full work kit — laptop, notebook, pen, backpack, keys, wallet, hat, jacket, shoes, and water bottle — all of which vanish from the house between about 8 and 17:30. Crucially, she leaves her phone charger plugged in at desk_b1 overnight and through the workday; the charger is found at desk_b1 on every weekday look. Her phone itself is at the nightstand in the evening and briefly at the entry table around 8:00 before she leaves.

Priya (sixties, retired) is the home anchor. **What changed from the parent:** the glasses_priya blocks and claim are revised. The parent document asserted her glasses are at desk_b1 during weekday 10–16h with "usually" confidence, but the evidence now shows the glasses are split: at the nightstand 4 of 9 weekday midday looks, at desk_b1 at 4 of those same hours, and on the bedroom floor at 2. The glasses are **not** a desk-b1 anchor object the way the headphones and pen are. They rest at the nightstand (their primary home) and are occasionally moved to desk_b1 while Priya reads or works, but they are equally likely to be found at the nightstand at any given midday look. The claim is therefore revised to expect the nightstand, and the desk_b1 block is downgraded to "sometimes" with a narrower 8–12h window (the sightings at 14:00 and 16:00 show the glasses at desk_b1 only 1 of 2 passes, while the nightstand also shows 1 of 2).

Her headphones and pen remain at desk_b1 all day (found 7/9 and 9/9 respectively during 9–17h). Her guitar stays on the bedroom floor. Her water bottle is at the dish rack or kitchen sink during the middle of the day. In the evening she is in the kitchen or living room.

The dog is fed by whoever is home. The bowl stays on the kitchen floor essentially all day; the toy stays on the living room floor. The leash hangs at the entry hook.

On weekends Elena sleeps in, does errands around midday, bakes, and cycles for recreation. Priya takes a late-morning walk and practices guitar in the afternoon.

What sets this hypothesis apart from the parent: the glasses are a nightstand object that occasionally visits desk_b1, not a desk-b1 anchor. Everything else (Elena's commute kit, charger at desk_b1, helmet at entry, Priya's headphones/pen at desk_b1, guitar on bedroom floor) is unchanged.

Refutation: if the glasses are found at desk_b1 on 8+ of 10 weekday midday looks (10–16h); if the charger is found out of the house during 9–17h; if the helmet is found out of the house on a weekday.
