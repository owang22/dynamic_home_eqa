# p_b2c9 — Transit commuter: full kit out, umbrella and charger stay home

Elena is a transit commuter who takes her full work kit out the door around 7:30–8:00 on weekdays and returns around 5:30. The kit includes: laptop, keys, wallet, phone, backpack, hat, jacket, shoes, notebook, pen, and water bottle. What stays home is equally important: the helmet hangs at the entry hook, the bike lock sits on the entry table, the charger remains at desk_b1, and the umbrella stays at the entry floor. The umbrella in particular never goes with her — every document that placed it at OUT_OF_HOUSE during work hours has failed against sightings. The charger is likewise never carried; it stays plugged in at the bedroom desk.

On weekdays between roughly 8:00 and 17:30, looking at the entry hook will find the helmet but not the laptop, backpack, hat, or jacket. Looking at the entry table will find the bike lock but not the keys or wallet. Looking at desk_b1 will find the charger. Looking at the entry floor will find the umbrella. All of Elena's personal items that are not in the work kit remain at their resting spots.

This differs from p_7ef3 (cyclist: helmet out) and p_1e82 (walker: bike lock out) — both are contradicted by 12/12 finds of helmet at entry_hook_e1 and bike lock at entry_table_e1 during work hours. It also differs from p_4a7c and p_9b2e which placed the charger at OUT_OF_HOUSE.

This would be refuted if the helmet or bike lock are ever found out of the house on a weekday, or if the umbrella is sighted at OUT_OF_HOUSE, or if the charger is found away from desk_b1 during work hours.
