# p_d4b7 — Laptop on the entry hook at night; out with Elena all workday

A fresh document built around the unusual dual-location pattern of laptop_elena. The per-hour sightings show the laptop at BOTH coffee_table_l1 and entry_hook_e1 at every overnight pass (00:00, 02:00, 04:00, 06:00, 08:00) and again at 20:00 and 22:00, but ONLY at coffee_table_l1 at 18:00. The weekday 9–17 h looks at coffee_table_l1 found the laptop 0 times and found nothing 4 times, confirming it is out of the house during work. The mixture's worst-objects list flags "laptop_elena: predicted coffee_table_l1, actually entry_hook_e1 — 5x," meaning the statistical model misses the hook location entirely.

Interpretation: Elena packs her laptop into her bag (backpack_elena) the night before and hangs it on the entry_hook_e1. The robot sees the laptop through the open bag at the hook, and also sees it at the coffee_table_l1 where she last used it the evening before (or where she briefly sets it down at 18:00 after getting home). By 08:00 the bag is on the hook and she grabs it to leave. During the workday the laptop is out. In the early evening (18:00) she sets it on the coffee table for a quick check, then by 20:00 it is back in the bag on the hook.

What sets this apart: every other document places the laptop at coffee_table_l1 as its single resting spot. This document predicts entry_hook_e1 as the overnight location (in the bag) and coffee_table_l1 only as a brief evening stop.

What would refute it: laptop_elena sighted at desk_o1 or desk_b1 at any time, or at coffee_table_l1 during 09:00–17:00 on a weekday.
