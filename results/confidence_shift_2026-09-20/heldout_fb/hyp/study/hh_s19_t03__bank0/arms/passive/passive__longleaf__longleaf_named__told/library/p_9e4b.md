# p_9e4b — The Saturday reset: vacuum noon, iron afternoon, social evening

Saturday is the household's chore-and-social day. The evidence shows a clear sequence: at 12:00 the vacuum cleaner is on floor_l_l1 (midday cleaning before guests arrive); at 15:00 the iron and ironing board are at bed_b2 (afternoon ironing session, getting ready for the evening); at 18:00 the ironing board is still at bed_b2 (session continues); and by the evening the living room is set up for social time (guitar on couch, blanket on couch, laptop at coffee table). The residents' message confirms: "friends coming over this evening."

Sunday is the rest day. The 03:00 pass shows everything in resting positions: laptop at bookshelf_l1 (shelved after a long weekend), vacuum back in storage, iron in storage. No chores on Sunday.

What sets this apart from p_5a1c and p_6d1f (which focus on the social evening): this document emphasizes the CHORE SEQUENCE and its timing. The vacuum is out for exactly one window (11:00–13:00), the ironing session is 14:30–18:30, and then the house transitions to social mode. The ironing board at bed_b2 at 15:00 AND 18:00 (two separate passes) confirms a long session, not a quick pass.

What would refute it: vacuum at floor_l_l1 on a weekday; or iron at bed_b2 on a Sunday afternoon (no weekend ironing on rest day).
