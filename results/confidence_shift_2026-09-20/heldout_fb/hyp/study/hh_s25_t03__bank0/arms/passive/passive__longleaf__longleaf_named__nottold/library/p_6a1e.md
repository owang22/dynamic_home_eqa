# p_6a1e — Cooking at 19:00; dinner at the dining table 20:00; TV wind-down to 22:30

The evening routine is tightly choreographed. Cooking begins around 18:30: the pan moves from the cupboard to the counter, the spatula comes out of the drawer to the counter, and the recipe book is pulled from the pantry shelf to the counter. By 19:00 the food is being prepared. At 19:30–20:00 the plates and glasses move from the cupboard to the dining table, and Marco's water bottle goes from the sink to the dining table. Dinner lasts until about 21:00. After dinner, both residents move to the living room: the remote goes from the TV stand to the floor (or is picked up), the blanket is on the couch, Marco's mug migrates from the desk/cupboard to the coffee table, and Omar's glasses end up on the armchair. The remote is found on the floor at 22:00, suggesting it is set down on the floor during TV and left there overnight.

What sets this apart from p_8e4a and p_2f8e (which focus on the cooking window but do not track the full evening arc): this document connects cooking → dinner → TV as a single sequence and places the remote on the floor (not the coffee table) during the TV window, matching the 22:00 sighting. What would refute it: the pan still in the cupboard at 19:00, the remote on the coffee table at 22:00, or plates still in the cupboard at 20:00.
