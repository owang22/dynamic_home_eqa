# p_f4d7 — The evening sequence: cook 17–19, dinner 19–21, TV 21–23, dog fed 20

This document models the full evening arc in sequence. Cooking begins at 17:00 (pot and recipe book at counter at 17:00, pot at counter at 19:00, recipe book at counter at 19:00). Dinner is served 19:00–21:00: Elena's plate, glass, and water bottle at dining_table at 20:00; Priya's glass and water bottle at dining_table at 19:00 and 21:00. The dog is fed around 20:00 (dog food bag at floor_k_k1 at 19:00, 20:00, 21:00). TV starts around 21:00 (remote at coffee_table at 22:00 x4, blanket at coffee_table at 22:00 x3). Elena's mug is at coffee_table from 18:00 through 23:00 (sightings at 18, 20, 21, 23). The pot returns to the cupboard/pantry by 20:00.

What sets this apart: the cooking window is 17–19 (not 17–18 or 18–20), dinner is 19–21, and the dog feeding is specifically at 20:00 with the food bag on the floor. What would refute it: the pot at the counter at 20:30, or the dog food bag at the pantry shelf at 20:00.
