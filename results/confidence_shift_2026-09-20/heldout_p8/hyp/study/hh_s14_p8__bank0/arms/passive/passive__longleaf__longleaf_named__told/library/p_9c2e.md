# p_9c2e — Only the lunchbox goes to work (fork of p_a3f1)

Two residents run a conventional two-adult household. Marco leaves for his afternoon-to-night shift around 13:40 and returns around 23:00 on weekdays; on weekends he is home except for a midday errand run (11:30–14:00). Yuki is home most of the day, taking a morning walk (07:00–08:30 weekdays, 10:00–11:30 weekends) and a shorter afternoon errand (14:30–16:00 weekdays only). The dog is fed by Yuki at 07:00 and 18:00, walked at 08:00 and 16:45. Meals are at 07:30, 12:30, and 18:30; evening TV runs 19:30–22:00. Marco bakes on weekday mornings (06:30–08:30); Yuki bakes on weekend afternoons (14:00–16:30). Marco journals and reads at the nightstand 22:30–00:00. Yuki plays guitar 15:00–16:30 on weekdays. Marco does yoga 06:00–06:45 weekdays.

What changed from the parent: the parent claimed that NOTHING of Marco's personal items travels out of the house during work hours. The evidence (10 looks at cupboard_k1 during 14–22 h found the lunchbox absent, while it was confirmed present at the cupboard on one occasion—likely just before he left or just after he returned) forces a revision: the lunchbox DOES go to work with Marco. However, the vitamins (counter_k1) and journal (nightstand_b1) are NOT confirmed to leave; they remain at their resting spots. The lunchbox is a work item (he eats it at his desk), while the vitamins and journal are home items (he takes his vitamins in the evening, journals before bed).

What sets this document apart from p_b7c2 and p_4a7f: between 14:00 and 23:00 on a weekday, lunchbox_marco is OUT_OF_HOUSE, but vitamins_marco is still at counter_k1 and journal_marco is still at nightstand_b1. If the robot finds the vitamins or journal out of the house during that window, this document is refuted on that point.
