# p_e8d1 — Marco's kit leaves at 13:40; the desk holds the journal; friends on Thursday

Two residents run a conventional two-adult household. Marco (forties) works afternoon-to-night shifts: home in the morning, out at work from about 13:40 until 23:00 on weekdays. On weekends he is home except for a midday errand run (11:30–14:00). Yuki (seventies) is retired and home most of the day, with a morning walk (07:00–08:30 weekdays, 10:00–11:30 weekends) and a shorter afternoon errand (14:30–16:00 weekdays). The dog is fed at 07:00 and 18:00, walked at 08:00 and 16:45. Meals at 07:30, 12:30, 18:30; evening TV 19:30–22:00. Marco bakes weekday mornings (06:30–08:30); Yuki bakes weekend afternoons (14:00–16:30). Marco journals at the nightstand 22:30–00:00. Yuki plays guitar 17:30–19:00 weekdays. Marco does yoga 06:00–06:45 weekdays.

This document models the full scope of what Marco takes to work. The evidence is unambiguous: every personal item that has a resting spot in the entry area or living room shows an empty look during 9–17 h on weekdays. Marco's keys (entry_floor_e1), jacket (entry_hook_e1), backpack (entry_hook_e1), notebook (entry_hook_e1), phone (coffee_table_l1), shoes (shoe_rack_e1), sunglasses (entry_table_e1), wallet (entry_table_e1), and water bottle (entry_hook_e1) are all absent during work hours. The lunchbox (cupboard_k1) and vitamins (counter_k1) are also absent. The journal, however, is NOT absent: it is at desk_b1 at 16:00, confirming it stays in the house. Its resting spot is the desk; it goes to the nightstand only when Marco is actively journaling (22:30–00:00) or reading in the early morning.

The Thursday message ("friends coming over this evening") introduces a one-off perturbation: on Thursday evening, the living room will be occupied by guests. The blanket, snack bowl, and remote may be in active use from 19:00 onward rather than the usual 19:30. Extra plates, glasses, and bowls may be set out. The board game may be brought to the coffee table. This is a single-evening deviation and does not change the weekday/weekend pattern for other days.

What sets this document apart: it is the most complete model of Marco's work kit (11 items out of the house) combined with the journal-at-desk correction and the guitar-on-couch correction. It also explicitly models the Thursday guest evening. If the robot finds any of Marco's kit items in the house during 14–22 h on a weekday, or finds the journal at the nightstand (rather than the desk) during that window, this document is refuted on that point.
