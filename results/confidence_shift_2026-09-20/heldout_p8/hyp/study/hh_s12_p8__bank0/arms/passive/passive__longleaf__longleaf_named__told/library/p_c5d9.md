# p_c5d9 — Hybrid three days; Priya's early desk before Elena's work

Elena works from the bedroom desk three weekdays a week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and commutes the other two (Tuesday, Thursday). She drives both ways, so the helmet and bike lock never leave the entry. On WFH days her laptop, notebook, and pen are at desk_b1 from 9 to 17; on commute days they leave with her in the backpack. The charger is permanently at desk_b1. Priya uses desk_b1 for her morning routine—glasses, pen, and book from 7 to 11—then moves to the living room or kitchen for the rest of the day. On Elena's commute days (Tue/Thu) Priya extends her desk time to 7–15 since the desk is unoccupied by Elena. The laptop rests on the coffee table in the evenings. The dog is fed by Priya at 7 and walked by Elena after 17:30.

What sets this apart: three WFH days means the laptop and notebook_elena are at desk_b1 on 60% of weekdays (vs 40% in p_a3f7, 0% in p_b4e8). Priya's desk time is shorter (7–11) on Elena's WFH days to avoid conflict, but longer (7–15) on commute days. The backpack is at the entry hook on WFH days (Elena leaves it by the desk or at the hook) but OUT_OF_HOUSE on commute days.

Refuted if: the laptop is at desk_b1 on a Tuesday or Thursday; Priya's glasses are at desk_b1 after 12 on a Monday; the helmet is out of the house; the backpack is at the entry hook during a weekday 9–17h look on a commute day.
