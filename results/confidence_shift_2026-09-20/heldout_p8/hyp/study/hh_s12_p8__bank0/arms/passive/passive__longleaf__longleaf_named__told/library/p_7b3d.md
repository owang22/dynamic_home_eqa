# p_7b3d — Priya's kitchen breakfast anchor; water bottle stays home

Priya is retired and home most of the day. Her morning routine centres on the kitchen: she makes tea and a light breakfast at the kitchen table around 07:30–09:00. Her personal bowl (bowl_priya) and mug (mug_priya) are at the kitchen table during this window, then go to the sink to be washed by mid-afternoon, and return to the cupboard by evening. Her water bottle (water_bottle_priya) rests at the dish rack when not in active use; it is NOT taken out of the house during her afternoon errands—she leaves it on the counter or rack and goes out with just her keys and sunglasses. The dog food bag is in the pantry shelf most of the time but appears on the kitchen table during the 07:00–08:00 feeding window.

Elena commutes on weekdays (full or hybrid—this document does not take a strong position on WFH frequency). She drives, so helmet and bike lock stay at the entry. Her personal items (laptop, notebook, pen, phone, keys, wallet) leave with her 8–17:30 on commute days.

What sets this apart: the water_bottle_priya is at dish_rack_k1 or sink_k1 during the day, NOT out of the house. This directly contradicts p_7890's claim that it is OUT_OF_HOUSE during afternoon errands (which was found at the sink on day 1 at 16:00). Priya's bowl and mug are at kitchen_table_k1 at 08:00 (breakfast), not in the cupboard. The dog food bag is at kitchen_table_k1 during the 07–08 feeding window, not just the pantry.

Refuted if: water_bottle_priya is found OUT_OF_HOUSE during 13–16h; bowl_priya is at the cupboard at 08:00 on a weekday; the dog food bag is never seen on the kitchen table.
