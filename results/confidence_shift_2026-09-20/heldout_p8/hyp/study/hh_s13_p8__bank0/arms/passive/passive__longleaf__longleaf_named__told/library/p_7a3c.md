# p_7a3c — The Entry Hook Overnight, The Office All Day

Hana (late twenties, office worker) follows a rigid commuter rhythm. Overnight and in the early morning (before 8), her laptop, pen, and charger rest at desk_b1 in bedroom 1 — she works or plans at the desk before leaving. Her water bottle is at the kitchen sink, filled and ready. Her jacket, keys, handbag, sunglasses, wallet, shoes, and scarf are all at the entry (hook, table, or rack) because she grabbed them the night before or is about to.

Between roughly 8:00 and 17:30 on weekdays, every one of those personal objects is OUT_OF_HOUSE with her at the office. The robot will find the entry hook bare, the desk empty, the sink without her bottle. This is the single most reliable pattern in the house: if it is a weekday and the clock reads 10:00, Hana's laptop is not in the house, her jacket is not on the hook, her keys are not on the table.

After 17:30, she comes home and dumps everything at the entry hook (laptop, pen, charger, water bottle) or back on the entry table (keys, wallet, sunglasses). The jacket goes on the hook. Shoes go on the floor by the entry. By 18:00 the entry area is a small pile of her things.

This document differs from p_f5a0 (which claims the laptop stays at desk_b1 all day) and p_d3e8 (which claims she dumps at the hook at 20:00 rather than 18:00). It also differs from p_b7c2 (which claims a hybrid two-days-at-desk schedule). The evidence of four consecutive weekday 9–17 h looks at the entry hook finding nothing, combined with the 18:00 re-appearance, rules out both the "laptop stays home" and "two days at desk" models.

What would refute this: finding Hana's laptop or jacket inside the house between 9:00 and 17:00 on a weekday more than once, or finding the laptop at desk_b1 rather than the entry hook at 18:00.
